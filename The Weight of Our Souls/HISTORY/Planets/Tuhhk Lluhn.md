## Day and Night Cycles

Due to Tuhhk Lluhn's extreme axial tilt of 92° during the **Summer** the planet's pole and large percentage of the hemisphere experiences constant daylight ("**midnight sun**") and for the **Winter** experiences constant night ("**polar night**)". During the spring and fall equinoxes the sun will face the equator, bringing about fairly normal day and night cycles that last 27 hours. During summer and winter the latitudes near the equator will also experience a odd day and night cycle. The sun rises east of due north, skirting the northern horizon to set west of due north a few hours later. 

## Intense Storms 

Due to the extreme temperature differences between the hemispheres, the planet experiences more extreme storms, cyclones, and monsoons. These storms usually last long periods of time before subsiding. Wind speeds in the atmosphere are also extremely fast, reaching speeds up to 1,700 km/hour.
