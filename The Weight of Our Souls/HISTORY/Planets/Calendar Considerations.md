Consider what “chunks” of time your fantasy calendar needs to include _before_ you commit to using a solar, lunar, or lunisolar calendar to save yourself a major headache.

For example, decades during which a particular dynasty reigned, centuries between celestial events, years spent at war…

Your custom calendar should be a tool that further refines your project. You should adjust the calendar around your storytelling or worldbuilding needs, not the other way around.

The calendar starts when Eazehb creates the universe from scratch, which would have created the Tuhhk Lluhn star system. 

Vestus and his scholars came to develop the calendar for Tuhhk Lluhn. They deemed the calendar started on the day their gods came to the planet to create their civilization (the first day of every new year is known as Creation Day). Using the technology they had they discovered that the time for their sun to travel from solstice to solstice was 770 days. They divided the day into 30 hours (based on the day/night cycle of the equator during the equinoxes), the hour 50 minutes, the minute 30 seconds. They counted all of this in the Base-9 system since that formed from the gods' nine children. The year is divided into two periods based on whether they are in their long summer or long winter period. Each period is divided into nine phases (again because of the nine gods).
