## The Arrival of Eazehb

**Eazehb** and her husband travelled into the primary universe from another one. They wanted to escape their previous universe because it had been torn apart by war. They would end the cycle of their people by restarting their race and avoiding the mistakes **Sehzaun** her father had made. Before they did this they had decided during their **Thousand Year Slumber** they had wanted children. They could help maintain the new universe. Together they had twelve children who came to be known as the **Twelve Deities.** The most prominent of these twelve was one known as **Azaziel.** **Azaziel** became the leader of the **Twelve** since he had the best qualities of a leader among them. The family saw that this universe was completely empty and named the nothingness around them the **Yawning Void.** They created a planet in this empty void which they made their home on. This became the new **Lkahsunahtehn** home world of **Tuehva Sehghzao**.  They built a small city on this planet to reside in and stationed Tuehva Lunvaehn above its orbit. After this was accomplished the family prepared for the **Day of Creation.**   
## The Day of Creation

**Eazehb** prepared for the **Day of Creation**. Many things had to be done in order to complete this monstrous task but eventually it was time. This would be different from when the **Founder** had used Tuehva Lunvaehn. First, she had to create an entire universe from scratch which was a lot more work. Second, she wanted to have more precise control over her creation to avoid the mistakes her father and the Founder had made. In order to do this she constructed the Well of Life above Lunvaehn's artificial soul core. By immersing herself in it she would connect her core to Lunvaehn's core and have a deeper connection than the Founder ever had. However, she did not foresee that problems would emerge from this bond since Lunvaehn's core was a copy of the Founder's. During the **Creation Ceremony** everyone was caught off guard and became alarmed as a chrysalis of ice and fire formed around Eazehb. Two streams of ice and fire shot off in each direction out of Lunvaehn and filled the entire universe. Eventually these rivers met each other and imploded to unpredictably create the elements of the new universe. After things had settled down a realm of ice and a realm of fire resided on opposite ends of the universe. Once this was completed **Eazehb** woke up unscathed. She had to rest for a bit before returning to their full strength. The rest of the new **Lkahsunahtehn** race had been created.

Unfortunately during this event she had accidentally killed her husband. They held a great funeral in their city and sent his body into space. They mourned for the next week in what came to be known as the **Week of Mourning.** They built a statues of him on **Sehghazo, Lunvaehn,** and the rest of the universe. However, they were alarmed when something destroyed one of their statues in the **Ice Realm.** 

## Rise of the Oso-Boghah & The Disease War 

After the **Week of Mourning** they began to explore this new universe they had made, it was a blank canvas for them to build upon. However, there was an unintended side effect. Since **Eazehb** was not in control when their universe was created they did not know what to expect. She had initially wanted to create the universe initially devoid of sapient life except for their own race so then they could populate it over time at their own pace. They were not too worried as **Eazehb** had thought she was partly in control. However, when they built one of their statues in the Ice Realm they had disturbed a race of beings frozen in the ice. Some of these beings were able to break free and unthaw the rest of their brethren. They quickly established a home on a planet nearby known as **Boghbsea.** The home was on a toxic planet with active volcanoes and an atmosphere filled with sulfuric acid. It was a hostile environment they adapted well to in order to ensure no one would invade them.  They quickly captured and tamed the large Omnidens that lived nearby. They used these to travel from system to system as they expanded their conquest. They formed the Oso-Boghah empire. They practiced dark magic and unholy ceremonies that twisted bodies and minds. They took people from their empire and experimented on them to be turned into soldiers. Disease and pestilence were rampant everywhere as a result of this. 

They were in a far corner of the universe so it took a while before Eazehb found them. She was disgusted at what she saw and sought to free all beings that were in their empire. She appointed Zenevul (one of the **Twelve Deities**) to lead the campaign against them. They struggled against some of their tactics as they had mastered the art of manipulating their soul cores. The war dragged on for many years until they captured **Boghbsea** and killed their council of kings. They pledged allegiance to **Eazehb** and disbanded their empire. Through this terrible conflict they learned they would need to bring order to the universe to prevent things like this from happening again.
