## The Founder Creates the **Lkahsunahtehn**

The **Founder** found himself as the only sapient being in his universe and decided he wanted his own people. As powerful as he was he could not create an entire race of people at his will, that would be very taxing on him. He studied his soul core for years and its connection to the universe. In his studies he discovered that everything in every universe was connected to a plane of existence known as the **The Plane Above All**. This was how he was able to use his soul core to manipulate the matter and energy around him. He built a giant construct that housed an artificial soul core known as **Tuehva Lunvaehn**. To help build this construct the **Founder** created a race known as the **Guardians** who guarded the temple after it was built. The **Founder** had a special connection with nature so they decided to outfit the structure with gardens and many natural elements. Before the creation he copied his own soul core to create the artificial soul core of **Lunvaehn**, so his soul core was connected to it. Therefore anything created through or connected to Lunvaehn would also be attached to him. He used his method to create the **Lkahsunahtehn** race because he wanted everyone to be in communion with each other and to hear each other's thoughts. This way, no one would be alone again. He also connected the rest of the already existing universe to **Lunvaehn.**

They quickly spread out across their universe and established a prosperous society. They could do almost anything they wanted to with their powers and sought mostly after the arts and recreation. However, with the exception of the Founder they could not live forever. They could live for hundreds of years but eventually they would die. No one thought this would change until one being came along that was different. The **Founder** saw he was outliving all his peers and living longer than any **Lkahsun** had before.  For this he was named **Sehzaun** for he seemed to have discovered immortality. Sehzaun studied his genetic code at Tuehva Lunvaehn to find out what was different about him. This was when he discovered a mutation had occurred in his **God Gene**.
## Sehzaun Changes the God Gene

Sehzaun promised immortality to every **Lkahsun**. The Founder warned Sehzaun that what he was doing was dangerous and to stop immediately. However, Sehzaun ignored the Founder's warnings and together with his daughter altered the **God Gene** for the entire **Lkahsunahtehn** race. Everyone was excited because they thought they could finally realize their full potential. Everyone started to use **Tuehva Lunvaehn** to further alter their genetic code in a never ending quest for more power. They had lived for so long they had begun to go mad.  They had become so obsessed they wanted to reach the **Plane Above All** itself. However, problems began to arise within the people. They had changed themselves so much that their soul cores were becoming corrupted, as well as the universe around them. Fighting broke out as people randomly attacked each other with irrational thought. Eventually, a destructive war enveloped the entire universe. 
## The War of Twilight 

The universe was in a state of free-for-all as various factions fought each other for dominance. However, Sehzaun had figured out a way with Tuehva Lunvaehn to raise the dead as his own army and brought unfathomable destruction wherever he went. No matter what **The Founder** did he could not reverse all the changes that **Sehzaun** had made through **Tuehva Lunvaehn**. However, he was able to reverse the corruption of some Lkahsun and recruited them to his side to fight in the war to reestablish order. Unfortunately, he knew he would not win and that this universe would end very shortly from all the destruction. **Sehzaun's** daughter felt great remorse for what she had helped her father do and wanted to atone for what she had done. The **Founder** sent her and her husband to another universe with **Tuehva Lunvaehn.** There they would start again and avoid the mistakes her father had made. 

One of the last battles of the war before the universe's end was the **Battle of Tuehva Lunvaehn**. The Founder's remaining forces fell to **Sehzaun's** undead warriors. They bought enough time for him to create a portal which **Eazehb** and her husband could escape through. It would take a long time for them to reach their universe and during that time they were put in a deep slumber. They escaped on one of their spaceships and with several **Guardians.**

## Thousand Years of Slumber 

It is said that **Eazehb** and her husband went through a thousand years of sleep before they reached their destination, although the exact amount of time is not known. During this time they had established a psychic link with each other through their soul cores. This allowed them to talk with each other in their dreams. They would often reminiscence about old memories and make plans for what kind of world they would build when they woke up. They decided they wanted to create a peaceful universe where everyone would work together as one community and not as individuals. This way people would work together for the common good and not their own selfish interests. They would also place limits on people's access to **Tuehva Lunvaehn** and their ability to use it. This slumber came to an end when they woke up and arrived in their new universe.
