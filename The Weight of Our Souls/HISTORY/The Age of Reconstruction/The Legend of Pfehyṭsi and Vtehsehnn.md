## Event Details 

After Vtehsehnn the Soul Keeper had trapped Azaziel and the rest of the demons in Elysium, he helped rebuild **Gamador** after the **War of Ash** and became co-leader of the **Cooperative Provisionary Government** which was a predessor to the **Vicar Council**. He was able to get this position because people hailed him a hero for what he did. People also called him 'Vtehs' as a nickname. It was a smaller council that acted as more of an oligarchy than the present day government. Vtehsehnn co-led with **Astradus** who represented one of the **Empyrean Guilds** which had gained power in the city. Vtehs found the work of rebuilding Gamador after the war exhausting, especially maintaining the balance between the demons and the ordinary people. He would often go outside the city and gaze at the stars in his refuge on a neighboring mountain. However, one of these nights his brother **Pfehyṭsi** surprised him on his dragon. His brother had been gone for quite a long time, disappearing ever since the aftermath of the war. There had been rumors he had gone to the south of Gamador and gained power as a warlord after learning the art of **Soul Core.** 

When they met his brother confirmed these rumors, offering him a chance to come rule alongside him and forget Gamador.  However, Vtehs denied that and gave him a counteroffer to give up his lawless lifestyle. For seven more days and nights this went back and forth between them. As **Pfehyṭsi** learned more about his brother's life he became jealous of him and his position. He decided he would become his brother's apprentice under false pretenses to learn more about what was happening in **Gamador**. During his apprenticeship **Pfehyṭsi** met Vtehs' wife, **Llasha**. Her name in **Lkahsunahtehn** means beautiful, and it matched because Pfeh was struck by her beauty. 

**Pfehyṭsi** decided he would steal his brother's entire life, including **LLasha.** He planned to make allies within the government, slowly gaining influence. When the time was right, he and his allies would frame his brother for the assassination of one of the council members. He planned to get rid of his brother on his own, however he knew he could not beat him in a fight. For months he trained in the magic of the **Soul Core**, learning everything about it he could. Eventually, he felt confident enough to fight his brother and exact his plan. However, **LLasha** had discovered his plan after some investigating since she did not completely trust **Pfehyṭsi**. 

After Vtehsehnn the Soul Keeper had trapped Azaziel and the rest of his followers in Elysium, he rested for a while in the **LLash** **Sanctuary** managed by his wife **Llasha**. The sanctuary was located on the neighboring plateau from **Gamador**. Meanwhile the **Cooperative Provisionary Government** was managed by his father and **Astradus**, one of the leaders of the **Empyrean Guilds**. His own guild, the **Dsheh Puhbkthaykur**, were having issues with the religion that worshipped **Astradus**. The **Watchers of Astradus** were always causing trouble for Astradus, doing things in his name without his approval. He wanted their leader dead. When he asked the government for help, they refused his request even though he argued it was to prevent further trouble from happening in the city. During a heated debate **Astradus** killed his father. **Vtehsehnn** came out of retirement at the request of the government to take the place of his father. Astradus was not removed from power due to his influence and position in the Guilds. 

Vtehsehnn was wary of Astradus and tried to deal with him carefully. He tried to put aside his anger that he felt at him. He held talks between Astradus and the head of the religion. After some discussion the leader agreed to officially integrating itself as apart of Astradus' guild and answering to Astradus officially. Word of this monumental achievement reached the ears of his brother **Pfehyṭsi**. He had spent his days since the **War of Ash** as a warlord in the south. He returned to his brother and begged him to leave Gamador behind and join him by his side. Vteh refused his offer and tried to convince him to give up his life of crime. This went on for a week until he finally convinced Pfeh. Pfeh agreed to serve as Vteh's apprentice. 

However, Pfeh soon became jealous of Vteh's life. He envied the way he was adored as a hero for the war and his position in the government. Most of all, he envied him for his beautiful wife Llasha. LLasha was well known in Gamador and loved by all for her work in her sanctuary gardens. She also ran several charity and healthcare programs for the poor. **Pfehyṭsi** began plotting how he would steal his brother's life. He began planning when he learned his brother would be gone for several months as apart of a delegation to a neighboring city in the east. That would leave him and several advisors acting as leaders of the **CPG**. He began to use the city's propaganda machine to spread lies about his brother that turned public opinion against him. He also made many allies in the government, promising them power in return for their support. 

The final part of his plan.
