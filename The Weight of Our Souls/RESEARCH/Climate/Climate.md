# Worldbuilding Seasons with High Axial Tilt 

## Fundamentals of High Axial Tilt 

- Earth’s tilt on its axis is 23.5 degrees or so, which is what gives us the seasons we know and love: bright warm summers and dark cool winters of equal length
  
- Seasons can easily be unequal in length with different setups; eccentric orbits cause longer winters and shorter summers, for reasons we might explore in another post.
  
- Increasing the axial tilt naturally leads to more extreme seasons; a tilt of, say, 30 degrees instead of 23 would lead to the temperate zones experiencing, relative to today, winters with longer nights and colder weather and summers with longer days and hotter weather
  
  - The most obvious effect would be on the sun’s path through the sky. The tropics, the highest latitudes where the sun appears directly overhead at any point during the year, are 23 degrees away from the equator because Earth’s tilt is 23 degrees.
  - A tilt of 30 degrees brings the tropics up to 30 degrees and the polar circles down to 60 degrees.
  - Once axial tilt exceeds 45 degrees there is no more temperate zone in terms of sunlight; under a 45 degree axial tilt both the polar circles and tropics are at 45 degrees latitude.
    
  ## Scenario 1: A World Turned on Its Side 
  
- Tropics rise to 85 degrees above the equator, polar circles rise to 5 degrees above the equator 
- Half a year of constant daylight and half a year of constant night. Normal day-night cycle near the equinoxes 
- Poles experience the most intense sunlight while the tropics are in perpetual twilight. Tropics are the coldest part of the planet 
- **If applied to Earth:**
	- Northern parts of the ocean never fall below freezing, holding in more heat. Eliminates polar ice caps and keeps the oceans keep the coasts warm during the winter to prevent snow 
	- In North America the Desert Southwest has the coldest winters, at under -10 degrees Celsius, with the American Rockies being the northernmost extent of the winter snowpack.
	- During the summer the arctic really heats up, with parts of northern Canada having the hottest summers, averaging over 80 degrees Celsius. That’s over 170 degrees Fahrenheit!
	- All of Canada, Alaska, and Greenland average over 50 degrees Celsius, or around 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Central and southern Mexico have the coldest summers, averaging near freezing, with snow persisting over the summer and forming glaciers in the higher altitudes of southern Mexico.
	- Eurasia is much the same as North America, but more extreme. Almost all of Africa and Eurasia is cold enough for snow in the winter, with Tibet having the coldest winters (at -30 Celsius) and coldest summers (-10 Celsius), spending the entire year well below freezing and covered in an ice cap,
	- Siberia, as is the case today, has the most extreme seasons, ranging from around freezing in the winter to, in parts of the north, well above 90 degrees Celsius in the summer. That’s around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, almost hot enough to boil water!
	- The Antarctic has less extreme seasonal variation than the Arctic does, ranging from somewhat below freezing in the winter to around 20 degrees Celsius in the summer.
	
# Scenario 2: Tilted Earth in Mar's Orbit: A Super Siberia? 

- By moving an Earthlike planet out to Mar's orbit and turning it on its side, the whole planet would be covered with ice like Hoth in this scenario, even the equator.  	
- The average temperature lowers from 15 degrees Celsius to -40 degrees Celsius
- High axial tilt affects temperature. Siberian summers would shift from 90 degree Celsius summers to 35 degrees and in the winter it would go from near freezing to -50 degrees Celsius. 
- Northern Canada gets a climate similar to modern Siberia, with even the summers being the same 
- Artic ocean remains frozen all year round with some of the coasts melting for the summer 
- Southern oceans have a warm belt which melts for the summer just above freezing  
- The rest of the world remains frozen all year round 
- **Main concept of the world**: A summer strong enough to thaw out the northern lands during the summer, permitting life to develop there. 
- Birds could migrate from the north during autumn to the south during the winter
- Vegetation similar to a taiga biome would be prevalent 
- A vast taiga surrounded by an ice sheet in every direction with six months of day and six months of night. 
- Is there still a small window of time where there is a normal daynight cycle? 

# Scenario 3: Maximizing the Seasons with Elliptical Orbits
- Orbit more elliptical produces homogeneous changes over the whole planet; the entire planet gets warmer when closer to the sun (perihelion), and the entire planet gets cooler when further from the sun (aphelion).
- Planets move faster when closer to their sun and slower when further from their sun, so eccentric Earths will have long winters and short summers.
- Perihelion could occur during northern summer, making the northern summer much more extreme, or it could occur during southern summer, making the southern summer much more extreme and the northern winter much more temperate
- For more extreme northern seasons, hotter summers and colder winters, have aphelion be in the winter and perihelion be in the summer
- It seems that with enough insulation creatures can withstand almost any cold, though survival in such conditions may require adaptations similar to Earth’s arctic and subarctic animals but more extreme. Worldbuilders that like to design creatures take note!
