# JESUS IS TEMPTED IN THE DESERT 

1. **The Spirit led Jesus**
	1. The Spirit led Jesus to be tempted. This was not an accident but something that was intended to happen. <br>
	2. He fasted for forty days and forty nights. That is a long time to go without any food and would be very painful. Jesus must've suffered during that period of time. 
<br>
2. **What does "Man shall not live by bread alone?" mean**
	1. We rely on God and nothing on this Earth for our strength. It did not matter if he turned stones into bread because he already had all the sustenance he would need. 
	<br>
	3. Jesus was quoting Deuteronomy 8:3 
		1. "He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD."
		2. This was to show that we should not rely on our flesh but humble ourselves by submitting to God and relying on Him. We destroy our own needs and desires to serve him
		3. God was testing the Israelites as he allowed them some troubles. He was also leading them to promised land and wanted them to remember what he had taught them. 
		<br>
	4. Jesus looked beyond our body 
		1. Jesus looked at us as a whole person with a mind, body, and spirit. We can merely sustain our fleshly body but sustain our spirit with His word. 
		2. God breathed his very life into us when he formed us from the dust of the earth. We need Him to survive
		3. Jesus completed what the Israelites could not, he became the perfect redeemer for our sins. 
		   <br>
3. **Jesus was not tempted** 
	1. Satan tries to tempt Jesus by taking him to the top of a temple and quotes scripture that says angels will catch him if he jumps. Jesus responds with a correct usage of scripture that states you should not tempt the Lord.  
	   <br>
	3. Satan also tries to tempt him by offering the entire world if he kneels down to worship him. This is the last straw as Jesus rebukes him by quoting this scripture:

	   >Away with you Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve."

# The Book of Enoch: The Watchers 
1. **The Watchers Abandon Their Posts** 
	1. The Watchers were a lesser rank of angels that were the middlemen between heaven and Earth. Everything that happened on Earth they ordained and conveyed to God.
	    
	2. They lusted after the daughters of the Earth and wanted to have them as their wives so they could bare children.
	    <br>
	3. Semjâzâ worried that not everyone would agree with the plan and punishment would fall entirely on him. 
	   <br>
	4. The ten Watcher chieftains swore an oath on Mount Hermon that they would see this plan through and fulfill it. They did fulfill it by going down to the earth and each one taking for himself one wife.
	   <br>
	5. They taught their wives different things such as enchantments and knowledge about plants. In other versions they also teach them the use of various technologies (?).
	   <br>
	6. Their wives gave birth to giants to started to devour what man had then eventually turned on mankind itself. They destroyed man and each other until they were condemned. 
	   <br>
	7. The Watchers taught humanity about different things and led them to be wicked 
		1. Azâzêl taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them **the metals**
		2. Semjâzâ taught enchantments, and root-cuttings
		3. Armârôs the resolving of enchantments
		4. Barâqîjâl taught astrology
		5. Kôkabêl the constellations
		6. Ezêqêêl the knowledge of the clouds
		7. Araqiêl the signs of the earth
		8. Shamsiêl the signs of the sun
		9. Sariêl the course of the moon
		   <br>
	8. Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel look down from Heaven and see the terrible things that are happening. They hear the cries of the souls that have died and bring their petition before God.
	   <br>
	9. They plead with God telling him that he sees all things and therefore must see what is happening on Earth. They tell of the evil Azâzêl has brought and the adultery Semjâzâ has committed. They saw the souls cannot cease their crying because of what has happened on the Earth. They close by saying they have not been told anything by God.
<br>
2. **God acts against them**
	1. Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel look down from Heaven and see the terrible things that are happening. They hear the cries of the souls that have died and bring their petition before God.
	   <br>
	2. They plead with God telling him that he sees all things and therefore must see what is happening on Earth. They tell of the evil Azâzêl has brought and the adultery Semjâzâ has committed. They saw the souls cannot cease their crying because of what has happened on the Earth. They close by saying they have not been told anything by God. 
	<br>   
1. **God warns Noah and punishes the Watchers**
	1. He sends Uriel to warn Noah and hide him away so he can bear future generations in the midst of a coming deluge
	   <br>
	2. He sends Raphiel to bind Azazel hand and foot. He casts him into a desert place called Dudael and is made not to see, covering his face in darkness.
	   <br>
	3. He tells Gabriel to destroy the children the Watchers had and to deny them any request the fathers make on their behalf. He also proclaims healing of the damage the Watchers did with the introduction of their evil knowledge.
	   <br>
	4. He tells Michael to bind Semjaza and his cohorts after they have seen the destruction of their son and loved ones. They to be bound to the valleys of the earth for seventy generations. On judgement day they will be burned up with fire.
	   <br>
	5. This is quoted after saying again to destroy the evil on the earth and the evil people associated with the watchers
	   <br>
	   > And then shall all the righteous escape,
	   > And shall live till they beget thousands of children
	   > And all the days of their youth and their old age
	   > Shall they complete in peace.
	   > 
		
	6. God talks about the rebirth of earth with abundant wine being pressed, new trees growing up, and vines being planted. Everything that has been destroyed is regrowing. The new generations are righteous, and calamity will not fall on them again.
	   
# Prose Edda Notes

1. The Prologue opens with a Christianized version of Norse mythology claiming Odin is the son of Thor (?) and came from Turkey. His people are called the Aesir and come from Asia apparently. Also, all the kingdoms of the north such as Norway and Sweden can trace their lineage to him.
   <br>
2. In the next section it strangely opens up with King Gylfi giving a piece of land to a woman named Gefjun who plowed it up with her oxen she was given. It claims it is now called the Lögr in Sweden
<br>
3. King Gylfi wants to learn magic from the Aesir and sets out to Asgard to learn their secrets. However, they see this coming and prepared deceptions ahead of him. In the hall there are meat and drinks aplenty with people constantly fighting. There are also three high thrones with kings on them
   <br>
4. Gylfi asks who is the foremost of all the gods. They respond by saying they have a god called Allfather with many names. Some of my favorites:  
    
	1. Nikudr or Striker  
	2. Far-Speaking One 
	3. The Burner 
	4. The Destroyer
	   <br>
5. Hel is the ninth world. Maybe have multiple worlds or realms in the series?
   <br>
6. Múspellheim is the hot, volcanic region in the south of Yawning Void while Niflheim is the cold icy, region in the north with the rain and yeasty venom that hardened like slag. Both of these regions grew in the void until they came to a collision point which formed the giant Ymir (also known as Aurgelimir).
   <br>
7. Audumla licked the ice blocks out of which Borr came. Odin was his son as well as his brothers Vili and Vé.
   <br>
8. They killed Ymir that his blood drowned almost all of the giants except Bergelmir who escaped on a ship with his family
   <br>
9. They took Ymir’s body and made the world with it as described here
	>Of Ymir’s flesh the earth was fashioned,  
	   And of his sweat the sea;  
	   Crags of his bones, trees of his hair,  
	   And of his skull the sky.  
	   Then of his brows the blithe gods made Midgard for sons of men;  
	   And of his brain the bitter-mooded  
	   Clouds were all created.”
	
10. Man was created because the gods walked along the shoreline and found two trees which they formed into the man Askr and the woman Embla. They built a city in the center of Midgard called Asgard or Troy. Odin sits atop his throne to see everything
    <br>
	1. Could be an interesting plot point to rebel against a god who sees and judges everything that you do
	   <br>
	2. The sun is afraid of two wolves that chase her. All wolves are created by witches to the east of Midgard in a forest called Ironwood.
	   <br>
	3. Urdr, Verdandi, and Skuld sit by the well of Urd determining men’s fates. There are many kinds of norns who determine different fates. Some are good, some are bad. The honeydew that falls from the well and/or tree to the earth is called honeydew by the men of the earth and bees are nourished on it.
	   <br>
	4. There are different gods dedicated to the coming of summer and winter. It could be an interesting worldbuilding choice to have that.
